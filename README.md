# Heisenber_Langevin_Delayed_Equations
This project showcases the code developed for the simulation of an array of emitters that interact with the electromagnetic field, placed on a one-dimensional waveguide. The reader can find the derivation of the model in the following [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02642)

Additionally, 'Article_notebook.ipynb' reproduces all of the graphs shown in the reference, up to format diferences.
